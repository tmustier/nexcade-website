## Four Platform Pillars (Tabbed Section)

### 1. Supercharge your SOPs
**Headline:** Supercharge your SOPs

**Copy:** Freight expertise built in from day one. Refined by your SOPs. Enriched with operator feedback. Every agent performs like your best team member.

**Key feature shown:** Custom instructions per customer
- Example: "For customer Acme Corp, route all European Import air freight into AMS on EXW Incoterms. Ensure T1 fee is quoted for cross-border delivery."
- Integrations panel showing Cargowise, O365

**Why it matters:** Agents follow your existing rules and customer-specific requirements. Not a black box — configurable.

---

### 2. Proactive and always on
**Headline:** Proactive and always on

**Copy:** Agents work around the clock, responding as soon as requests hit your inbox, automatically handling clarifications and follow ups to keep jobs moving while you sleep.

**Key feature shown:** Agent timeline
- NEX-77 Quote accepted, booking initiated in Cargowise
- NEX-78 Requesting rates: Emailed Globex Cargo + 5 more...
- NEX-81 Missing services: No destination agent available (View →)
- NEX-83 Quote sent to customer
- NEX-84 Rates ready for review (View →)

**Why it matters:** Addresses the "4am Shanghai wait" — overnight processing, proactive supplier outreach, automatic follow-ups.

---

### 3. Control and Governance
**Headline:** Control and Governance

**Copy:** AI does the heavy lifting. Your team stays in the loop for oversight, and agents learn from every correction.

**Key feature shown:** Missing services alert
- "No destination agent available in SIN"
- Missing services: Terminal Handling, Documentation, Haulage
- "Add Supplier" button

**Why it matters:** Human-in-the-loop always. System learns and improves. You stay in control.

---

### 4. Fully interoperable
**Headline:** Fully interoperable

**Copy:** Seamlessly connects with all your existing stack: TMS, RMS, email, carrier portals. No need to rip and replace.

**Key feature shown:** Integration diagram
- Integrations: Cargowise, Maersk, Descartes, chain.io, Freightify, Front, Sedna
- Nexcade Platform sits in the middle
- Connects to: AI Agents, Workflows, Analytics
- Knowledge graph visualization

**Why it matters:** Not a rip-and-replace. Works with existing systems. Pre-CargoWise wedge positioning.

## "Freight workflows on autopilot" Section

Three workflow types shown:

### Quoting (Current focus)
Maximise margin on every spot quote. Dramatically improve time-to-quote, especially for non-standard cargo, automate vendor outreach to secure the best rates at scale and leverage your data to price freight more intelligently.

### Procurement (Future/secondary)
Whether securing rates in a tender process or managing ongoing tariffs, Nexcade automates the entire communication flow with carriers, agents, and local offices, so you can improve visibility and efficiency.

### Booking (Future/secondary)
Streamline your ops handover process with our booking agent. Customer orders are identified and entered, shipment handover completed, and bookings are made with carriers automatically.

## Key Messaging Themes to Preserve

1. **Not a black box** — SOPs, custom instructions, human approval
2. **Always on** — overnight processing, timezone coverage
3. **Learns from you** — operator feedback improves agents
4. **Fits your stack** — integrations, no rip-and-replace
5. **Beyond quoting** — procurement, booking (future roadmap)
6. **Your best team member** — agents perform like your best pricer
